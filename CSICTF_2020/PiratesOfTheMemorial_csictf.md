## Solution
So in this challenge we were given a picture of the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata.
I did a Google reverse image search and found this picture in the first few results.
I then a found a twitter link and this just lead me down a rabbit hole.
So then I retried this challenge on day 2.
This time I did a yandex reverse image search and found a another link to the picture on twitter.
However this time in the comment section the Instagram ID of the original photographer was posted.
I quickly stalked him up and found the flag in one of his comments.
