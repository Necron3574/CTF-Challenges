# Lo Scampo
## Description
```
Malcolm X took Broiestevane to a Day of the Dead themed party but she never returned.
Her only friends, Mr Bean and the Pink Panther realised that she was missing when she didn't show up for an exam.
Broiestevane liked posting pictures, where was the party held?
```
## Solution
```Ok tbh the description scared the crap outta me.
I bet im not the only one whos never heard of `Broiestevane`
But nevertheless I took out my favourite osint tool *drumroll* `sherlock`. Here's the link to it `https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock`.
So for those who dont have sherlock, what it does is it gives you a list of sites for any username you input.
So I instinctively put in `Broiestevane` and got an instant hit on Instagram.
I went to the Instagram account and found the link to a `Day of the Dead` themed party.
I followed the link and reached the instagram page of the party which clearly stated where the party was held.
I just wrapped the name of the place with underscores and flag format and I got the flag.
```
